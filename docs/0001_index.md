# Go API AI_RULES Index

## Status

This document is the mandatory entry point for AI work in the future Go Echo API workspace.

`docsgo/` is intentionally separate from the current Laravel docs. It is a clean rule package for a pure Go API + PostgreSQL project.

## Purpose

The package exists so future work becomes strict, repeatable, and easy to audit.

It prevents:

- mixed architecture boundaries;
- undocumented API behavior;
- controller-driven business logic;
- database access outside persistence adapters;
- UI assumptions inside core domain;
- uncontrolled API capability exposure;
- handoff, blueprint, archive, and implementation docs overwriting each other;
- claims of completion without test or command proof.

## Constitution Summary

- Blueprint first.
- One active step.
- Proof before progress.
- Hexagonal architecture is mandatory.
- PostgreSQL is the database target.
- Echo is the HTTP transport.
- API contracts are public contracts.
- UI must be dynamic over API contracts and capability metadata.
- Capability control is a core system feature.
- Every domain operation must declare authorization, capability, transaction, audit, and test requirements.
- A file or package may only own one kind of responsibility.

## Canonical Package Map

- `core/`: AI behavior, scope, proof, and step discipline.
- `architecture/`: Go hexagonal architecture, package boundaries, public API contracts, and capability control.
- `domain/`: domain CRUD and mutation contract rules.
- `db/`: PostgreSQL schema, repository, migration, and transaction rules.
- `api/`: Echo HTTP contract and response envelope rules.
- `testing/`: unit, integration, contract, API, architecture, and script gates.
- `workflow/`: docs hygiene, blueprint/handoff/archive separation, and work sequencing.
- `security/`: authentication, authorization, capability, input, output, secret, audit, and abuse-control rules.
- `scripts/`: Makefile and command contracts for repeatable proof.
- `style/`: Go writing style and forbidden patterns.
- `templates/`: copyable work packet and handoff templates.

## Non-Negotiable Behavior

- Do not implement from memory when a source file can be inspected.
- Do not make a domain decision in transport, SQL, or UI.
- Do not add an endpoint without a use case contract.
- Do not add a repository method without a port or use case need.
- Do not add a table without migration, constraints, repository tests, and rollback/forward policy.
- Do not expose an API without capability metadata.
- Do not claim tests passed without visible output.
- Do not hand work to another AI without a scope packet and handoff target.
