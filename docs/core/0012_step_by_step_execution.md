# Step By Step Execution

## Purpose

Keep work controlled and reviewable.

## Rule

One response may contain only one active step.

An active step must have:

- one target;
- one bounded scope;
- one expected output;
- one proof method.

## Valid Active Step Examples

- Add a domain contract doc for one module.
- Add one use case and its unit test.
- Add one repository method and integration test.
- Add one Echo handler for an existing use case.
- Add one migration and database test.
- Add one capability-control registry entry and API test.

## Invalid Active Step Examples

- "Build the whole finance module."
- "Make all CRUD."
- "Clean architecture and tests."
- "Fix docs and implementation."

## Completion Rule

After the active step has proof, stop and wait for user feedback before the next step.
