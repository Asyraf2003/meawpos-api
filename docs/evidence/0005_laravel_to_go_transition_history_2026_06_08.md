```

## Completed Work History

- Docs consolidation and AI workflow rules exist under `docs/`.
- Codex, web AI, analysis, testing, evidence, and resume templates exist under `docs/templates/`.
- Web AI GitHub connector rules are documented as read-only by default.
- Prompt template selection rule exists so next-session prompts must select exactly one target agent and one matching template source.
- Hybrid Web AI/Codex next-session prompts are forbidden unless explicitly requested as a collaboration packet.
- AI execution channel boundaries are clarified: Web AI no longer defaults to Codex as executor, owner/local terminal command-plan loop is documented, and collaboration packet remains special-case only.
- Normal Web AI analysis must prefer owner/local terminal command plans and omit Codex handoff unless explicitly requested.
- Manual debug login foundation is documented in `docs/handoffs/2026-06-06-manual-auth-login.md`.
- Manual debug accounts are documented as `admin@example.com` and `kasir@example.com` with password `12345678`.
- Capability-control foundation is closed with proof.
- Capability contracts, PostgreSQL state, runtime middleware, route seeds, admin HTTP surface, route audit, disabled-route proof, and final closeout are recorded in related handoffs.
- ServiceCatalog domain contract is accepted.
- ServiceCatalog slice 1 domain, ports, usecase contracts, and unit tests are implemented with proof.
- ServiceCatalog PostgreSQL persistence slice is implemented with migration, repository adapter, integration tests, and proof.
- Docs quality feedback crosscheck added quick reference, evidence status index, incomplete evidence marker, blueprint/log boundary rule, concrete ServiceCatalog scope packet example, and ADR proof index.
