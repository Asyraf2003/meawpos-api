# Evidence

This folder stores proof references and command-output summaries.

Do not claim completion from plans. Completion requires proof.

Progress ledgers for long-running transitions may also live here when each estimate is tied to proof.

Active ledgers:

- `0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md`: current Laravel-to-Go API transition status.

## Evidence Status Index

Use this index before treating an evidence file as complete proof.

| File | Status | Use Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0001_laravel_stage0_schema_and_route_inventory.md` | Partial source inventory | Use for captured Laravel schema and route facts only. Do not treat omitted alter, foreign key, index, timestamp, or seed migrations as proven. |
| `0002_laravel_productcatalog_servicecatalog_inventory.md` | Partial source inventory | Use for ProductCatalog and ServiceCatalog facts captured from provided Laravel source. Product duplicate policy still needs owner decision. |
| `0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md` | Active ledger | Use as the current transition status, progress, gaps, and next valid active step source. |
| `0004_adr_implementation_proof_index.md` | Active proof index | Use as the current map from accepted ADRs to implementation proof status and remaining ADR proof gaps. |
| `0005_laravel_to_go_transition_history_2026_06_08.md` | Historical proof snapshot | Use for completed-work history that was moved out of the active ledger to reduce context load. |
| `2026-06-13_api_architecture_product_status_review.md` | Pre-smoke status review | Use for the ProductCatalog catalog API, Product/inventory, architecture, docs/handoff cleanliness, and next-slice assessment before runtime smoke proof. Runtime smoke status is superseded by `2026-06-14_productcatalog_runtime_smoke_proof.md` and the active ledger. |
| `2026-06-14_productcatalog_runtime_smoke_proof.md` | Complete local runtime evidence | Use as proof that ProductCatalog runtime smoke is locally proven through local PostgreSQL, migrations, Echo server, manual auth token presence, protected ProductCatalog HTTP routes, DB-backed create/show, and reversible capability guard behavior. |
| `2026-06-06-auth-runtime-local-dev.md` | Incomplete local runtime evidence | Use only for the DB connectivity facts explicitly recorded in the file. Do not use it as complete manual auth runtime proof. |

Partial or incomplete evidence can support only the facts written inside that file.

Do not close a gap from a partial or incomplete evidence file unless the missing proof is added or referenced by the active ledger.

Incomplete evidence review trigger:

- review incomplete evidence at least before the next active scope in the same domain;
- review `2026-06-06-auth-runtime-local-dev.md` by 2026-06-15 or before the next auth runtime change, whichever comes first.
