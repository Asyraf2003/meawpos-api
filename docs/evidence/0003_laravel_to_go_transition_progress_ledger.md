## Current Decision

Do not start broad Laravel code translation yet.

Capability-control foundation is closed with owner/local proof on 2026-06-08.

The valid order is:

1. Keep the progress ledger current.
2. Start the first POS business-domain blueprint/domain contract.
3. Repair or prove remaining runtime/security proof gaps as their own scopes.
4. Complete missing Stage 0 inventory batches before domain implementation.
5. Start `servicecatalog` only after an accepted domain contract and capability seed decision.
6. Start `productcatalog` only after an accepted domain contract and capability seed decision.

Protected POS CRUD implementation must wait for accepted domain contracts, POS PostgreSQL baseline decisions, authorization/capability mapping, transaction/audit decisions, and tests.

## Stage Progress

| Stage | Scope | Status | Estimate | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stage 0 | Laravel source inventory and parity matrix | Partial | 40% | `0001_laravel_stage0_schema_and_route_inventory.md`, `0002_laravel_productcatalog_servicecatalog_inventory.md` |
| Stage 1 | Go quality foundation | Partial | 90% | `make verify` passes, including tests, vet, format, AI rules, file-size, hexagonal, route-to-capability audit, and gosec |
| Stage 2 | PostgreSQL target baseline for POS domains | Not started | 0% | No accepted POS PostgreSQL migration baseline proof yet |
| Stage 3 | API foundation and capability control | Closed | 100% | Auth/session foundation exists; capability contracts pass tests; PostgreSQL capability migration is applied; PostgreSQL adapter integration tests pass; runtime capability middleware tests pass; protected route seed migration exists; admin HTTP surface implementation and full `make verify` proof pass; route-to-capability audit script exists and is wired into `make verify`; route-level disabled protected endpoint proof passes for current protected route capability keys; final closeout proof passed on 2026-06-08 |
| Stage 4 | Cross-cutting modules | Not started | 0% | No audit/language/notification/idempotency transition implementation proof yet |
| Business Phase 1 | Service catalog and product catalog | Not started | 0% | Catalog evidence and blueprint exist; Go business modules not implemented |
| Overall Laravel-to-Go transition | POS API migration | Early foundation | 20% | Docs, auth debug lane, full verify gate, capability contracts, capability PostgreSQL state, runtime capability middleware, protected route seeds, admin capability HTTP surface, and route-to-capability audit exist; POS domains are not implemented |

## Completed Work With Proof

- Docs consolidation and AI workflow rules exist under `docs/`.
- Codex, web AI, analysis, testing, evidence, and resume templates exist under `docs/templates/`.
- Web AI GitHub connector rules are documented as read-only by default.
- Prompt template selection rule exists so next-session prompts must select exactly one target agent and one matching template source.
- Hybrid Web AI/Codex next-session prompts are forbidden unless explicitly requested as a collaboration packet.
- AI execution channel boundaries are clarified: Web AI no longer defaults to Codex as executor, owner/local terminal command-plan loop is documented, and collaboration packet remains special-case only.
- A Web AI output test found residual Codex-default behavior: normal analysis still emitted `HANDOFF TEXT FOR CODEX`.
- Templates are tightened so normal Web AI analysis must prefer owner/local terminal command plans and omit Codex handoff unless explicitly requested.
- Prompt template hardening is a workflow/docs quality improvement and does not increase POS implementation progress.
- Prompt template hardening proof is recorded in `docs/handoffs/2026-06-07-prompt-template-selection-rule.md`; `make verify` passed after the docs change.
- AI execution-channel boundary proof is recorded in `docs/handoffs/2026-06-07-ai-execution-channel-boundaries.md`; `make verify` passed after the docs change.
- Web AI owner/local terminal output proof is recorded in `docs/handoffs/2026-06-07-web-ai-owner-terminal-output-test.md`; `make verify` passed after the docs change.
- Manual debug login foundation is documented in `docs/handoffs/2026-06-06-manual-auth-login.md`.
- Manual debug accounts are documented as:
  - `admin@example.com` with password `12345678`;
  - `kasir@example.com` with password `12345678`.
- Quality and architecture audit scripts are documented as wired.
- Capability domain, port, and usecase contracts exist under `internal/modules/capability/`.
- Capability contracts have unit test proof in domain and usecase packages.
- Full `make verify` proof passes, including gosec.
- Capability PostgreSQL migration `0006_capability_control.up.sql` is applied locally.
- Capability PostgreSQL repository integration tests pass.
- Runtime capability middleware exists under `internal/transport/http/middleware`.
- Runtime capability middleware tests prove enabled capability allows handler execution, disabled capability returns `403` before handler execution, checker errors return `500`, and misconfigured guards return `500`.
- Protected route capability seed migration `migrations/0007_seed_existing_protected_capabilities.up.sql` exists for current protected routes.
- Migration `0008_seed_capability_manage_permission` adds `capability.manage`, assigns it to `admin`, and seeds `api_capabilities.key = 'capability.manage'`.
- Capability response DTO mapping exists under `internal/presentation/http/id/capability/`.
- Admin capability list/show/enable/disable handler exists under `internal/modules/capability/transport/http/`.
- Bootstrap wires `/api/admin/capabilities...` behind authn, `capability.manage` authorization, and runtime capability check.
- User-provided SQL proof confirmed `capability.manage` permission, admin role assignment, and `api_capabilities` row.
- Local proof confirmed capability handler files pass file-size audit, focused capability tests pass, bootstrap tests pass, and `make verify` passes.
- Route-to-capability audit script exists with manifest coverage for 6 current protected route capability rows.
- `make verify` summary now includes route capability audit and passes aggregate audit.
- Route-level disabled protected endpoint proof passes for current protected route capability keys.
- Capability-control foundation closeout proof passed on 2026-06-08 with focused tests, route capability audit, DB migration status, and `make verify`.
- DB migration status confirmed `0006_capability_control.up.sql`, `0007_seed_existing_protected_capabilities.up.sql`, and `0008_seed_capability_manage_permission.up.sql` are applied.
- Final closeout `make verify` passed with gosec reporting 97 files, 3978 lines, 0 nosec, and 0 issues.

## Open Gaps

- Full Laravel source inventory is incomplete for many business domains.
- Laravel alter, foreign key, index, timestamp, and seed migrations are not fully inventoried.
- Product duplicate policy still needs an owner decision before final PostgreSQL indexes.
- Runtime DB proof for manual auth login is still incomplete.
- No POS domain PostgreSQL baseline has been accepted.
- ServiceCatalog domain contract is accepted.
- ServiceCatalog implementation slice 1 plan exists but is not accepted yet.
- ProductCatalog domain contract has not been accepted yet.
- No `servicecatalog` or `productcatalog` Go business module has implementation proof.

## Next Valid Active Step

Continue `docs/blueprints/0025_servicecatalog_implementation_slice_1.md`.

- Review and accept or adjust the ServiceCatalog implementation slice 1 plan.
- Do not implement before the implementation slice is accepted.
- Keep slice 1 limited to domain and usecase contracts with tests.
- Do not add HTTP, PostgreSQL migrations, PostgreSQL repositories, route registration, or capability seeds in slice 1.
## Handoff Requirement

Any Codex or web AI session that changes Laravel-to-Go transition docs, capability foundation, quality gates, or POS domain implementation must update this ledger or explicitly state why the ledger is unchanged.

The same session must create or update a handoff when durable work was done.

## Context Window Status

Current ledger update context status: updated after capability-control foundation closeout proof; enough context for the first POS business-domain blueprint/domain contract.
