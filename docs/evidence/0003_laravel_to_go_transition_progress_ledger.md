## Current Decision

Do not start broad Laravel code translation yet.

Capability-control foundation is closed with owner/local proof on 2026-06-08.

The valid order is:

1. Keep the progress ledger current.
2. Start the first POS business-domain blueprint/domain contract.
3. Repair or prove remaining runtime/security proof gaps as their own scopes.
4. Complete missing Stage 0 inventory batches before domain implementation.
5. Start `servicecatalog` only after an accepted domain contract and capability seed decision.
6. Start `productcatalog` only after an accepted domain contract and capability seed decision.

Protected POS CRUD implementation must wait for accepted domain contracts, POS PostgreSQL baseline decisions, authorization/capability mapping, transaction/audit decisions, and tests.

## Stage Progress

| Stage | Scope | Status | Estimate | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stage 0 | Laravel source inventory and parity matrix | Partial | 40% | `0001_laravel_stage0_schema_and_route_inventory.md`, `0002_laravel_productcatalog_servicecatalog_inventory.md` |
| Stage 1 | Go quality foundation | Partial | 90% | `make verify` passes, including tests, vet, format, AI rules, file-size, hexagonal, route-to-capability audit, and gosec |
| Stage 2 | PostgreSQL target baseline for POS domains | Partial | 10% | ProductCatalog PostgreSQL migration 0011 has local DB apply proof; repository adapter proof is not started |
| Stage 3 | API foundation and capability control | Closed | 100% | Auth/session foundation exists; capability contracts pass tests; PostgreSQL capability migration is applied; PostgreSQL adapter integration tests pass; runtime capability middleware tests pass; protected route seed migration exists; admin HTTP surface implementation and full `make verify` proof pass; route-to-capability audit script exists and is wired into `make verify`; route-level disabled protected endpoint proof passes for current protected route capability keys; final closeout proof passed on 2026-06-08 |
| Stage 4 | Cross-cutting modules | Not started | 0% | No audit/language/notification/idempotency transition implementation proof yet |
| Business Phase 1 | Service catalog and product catalog | Partial | 43% | ServiceCatalog domain/usecase, PostgreSQL persistence, and runtime/capability slice have local proof; ProductCatalog domain, ports, CreateProduct, UpdateProduct, SoftDeleteProduct, RestoreProduct, GetProductDetail, ListProducts, LookupProducts, and ListProductVersions behavior have local focused and aggregate proof; connector validation passed for the latest ProductCatalog behavior checkpoint |
| Overall Laravel-to-Go transition | POS API migration | Early foundation | 32% | Docs, auth debug lane, full verify gate, capability foundation, ServiceCatalog domain/usecase, PostgreSQL persistence, runtime/capability proof, and ProductCatalog domain/usecase local proof exist; ProductCatalog connector validation and broader POS APIs remain incomplete |

## Current State Summary
- Capability-control foundation is closed with proof.
- ServiceCatalog domain contract is accepted.
- ServiceCatalog slice 1 domain, ports, usecase contracts, and unit tests are implemented with proof.
- `make verify` passes, including Go tests, go vet, format, AI rules, file-size, hexagonal import, route capability audit, and gosec.
- ADR implementation proof index exists at `docs/evidence/0004_adr_implementation_proof_index.md`.
- Detailed completed-work history is archived in `docs/evidence/0005_laravel_to_go_transition_history_2026_06_08.md`.
- ServiceCatalog PostgreSQL persistence slice is implemented and closed with proof.
- ServiceCatalog runtime/capability blueprint 0027 is accepted and locally proven through focused handler tests, ServiceCatalog-specific disabled-capability proof, and aggregate audit.
- ServiceCatalog runtime/capability slice 0027 is locally implemented with proof.
- ServiceCatalog HTTP transport, route registration, request/response presenters, authorization/capability wiring, route capability manifest coverage, audit coverage, and capability/permission seed migration 0010 have local proof.
- Migration `0010_seed_service_catalog_permissions_capabilities.up.sql` is applied in local database proof.
- ProductCatalog ListProducts contract, constructor/skeleton, reader error propagation, query forwarding, success mapping, and empty-list behavior are remote-visible through GitHub connector with focused `go test ./internal/modules/productcatalog/...` proof and aggregate `make verify` proof.
- ProductCatalog LookupProducts contract, constructor/skeleton, reader error propagation, query forwarding, success mapping, and empty-list behavior are remote-visible through GitHub connector with focused `go test ./internal/modules/productcatalog/...` proof and aggregate `make verify` proof.
- ProductCatalog ListProductVersions behavior is locally implemented with focused `go test ./internal/modules/productcatalog/...` proof and aggregate `make verify` proof; connector validation passed through GitHub connector.

## Open Gaps
- Full Laravel source inventory is incomplete for many business domains.
- Laravel alter, foreign key, index, timestamp, and seed migrations are not fully inventoried.
- Product duplicate policy Option A is accepted locally with proof; final PostgreSQL indexes must preserve Laravel-compatible duplicate behavior.
- Runtime DB proof for manual auth login is still incomplete.
- ADR `0009` debug auth lane remains partial because manual auth runtime proof evidence is incomplete.
- ADR `0012` API output contract centralization remains partial because full response/error envelope coverage is not proven for every API surface.
- ADR closeout backlog:
  - ADR `0009`: close by 2026-06-15 or before the next auth runtime change, whichever comes first.
  - ADR `0012`: close before adding broad new HTTP surfaces beyond the next accepted ServiceCatalog slice.
- No POS domain PostgreSQL baseline has been accepted.
- ServiceCatalog domain contract is accepted.
- ServiceCatalog implementation slice 1 plan is accepted and implemented with proof.
- ProductCatalog domain, ports, CreateProduct, UpdateProduct, SoftDeleteProduct, RestoreProduct, GetProductDetail, ListProducts, LookupProducts, and ListProductVersions behavior are locally proven; connector validation passed for the latest behavior checkpoint.
- No ProductCatalog PostgreSQL repository adapter, runtime HTTP surface, route registration, presenter, capability seed, inventory mutation, or UI implementation proof exists yet. ProductCatalog PostgreSQL migration 0011 has local DB apply proof.
- ServiceCatalog runtime/capability implementation is remote-visible through GitHub connector with local proof; focused handler and disabled-capability proof are remote-visible through GitHub connector with local proof; connector validation passed for the latest closeout proof files.
- ProductCatalog domain contract blueprint `docs/blueprints/0028_productcatalog_domain_contract.md` is accepted locally with Option A duplicate policy and `make verify` proof; connector validation pending.
- ProductCatalog implementation slice 1 blueprint `docs/blueprints/0029_productcatalog_implementation_slice_1.md` is accepted locally with `make verify` proof; connector validation pending.
- ProductCatalog domain package, ports, CreateProduct, UpdateProduct, SoftDeleteProduct, RestoreProduct, GetProductDetail, ListProducts, LookupProducts, and ListProductVersions behavior are locally proven with focused `go test ./internal/modules/productcatalog/...` proof and aggregate `make verify` proof; connector validation passed for the latest behavior checkpoint.
- ProductCatalog ListProducts query forwarding, success item mapping, and empty-list behavior are remote-visible through GitHub connector with focused `go test ./internal/modules/productcatalog/...` proof and aggregate `make verify` proof.
- ProductCatalog implementation slice 1 is closed after ListProductVersions behavior connector validation.
- ProductCatalog PostgreSQL persistence blueprint `docs/blueprints/0030_productcatalog_postgres_persistence_slice.md` is accepted. ProductCatalog PostgreSQL persistence blueprint includes performance and flexibility standards for CRUD, show, list, lookup, duplicate guard, and version-list query paths. ProductCatalog migration `0011_create_product_catalog_tables.up.sql` has local DB apply proof; repository adapter implementation has not started.

## Next Valid Active Step

Validate ProductCatalog PostgreSQL migration-only checkpoint through GitHub connector before starting repository adapter skeletons.

- Do not start ProductCatalog PostgreSQL, Echo/runtime, migrations, capability seed, inventory mutation, or UI work in this slice.
- Do not start a new runtime slice while local proof is not reflected in repository facts.
- Do not start ProductCatalog PostgreSQL, Echo/runtime, migrations, capability seed, inventory mutation, UI, or runtime HTTP slice before the next accepted blueprint/scope.

## Handoff Requirement

Any Codex or web AI session that changes Laravel-to-Go transition docs, capability foundation, quality gates, or POS domain implementation must update this ledger or explicitly state why the ledger is unchanged.

The same session must create or update a handoff when durable work was done.

## Context Window Status

Current ledger update context status: updated after ProductCatalog PostgreSQL migration-only local DB proof; next step is connector validation before repository adapter skeletons.
