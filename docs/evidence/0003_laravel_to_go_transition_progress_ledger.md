## Current Decision

Do not start broad Laravel code translation yet.

The valid order is:

1. Keep the progress ledger current.
2. Complete capability-control foundation proof.
3. Repair or prove security audit gate.
4. Complete missing Stage 0 inventory batches.
5. Start `servicecatalog`.
6. Start `productcatalog`.

Protected POS endpoints must wait for capability-control proof.

## Stage Progress

| Stage | Scope | Status | Estimate | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stage 0 | Laravel source inventory and parity matrix | Partial | 40% | `0001_laravel_stage0_schema_and_route_inventory.md`, `0002_laravel_productcatalog_servicecatalog_inventory.md` |
| Stage 1 | Go quality foundation | Partial | 70% | `2026-06-06-manual-auth-login.md` handoff reports passing format, vet, hex, docs, file-size, and auth tests; gosec remains unproven |
| Stage 2 | PostgreSQL target baseline for POS domains | Not started | 0% | No accepted POS PostgreSQL migration baseline proof yet |
| Stage 3 | API foundation and capability control | Partial | 20% | Auth/session foundation exists; capability blueprint exists; capability implementation proof missing |
| Stage 4 | Cross-cutting modules | Not started | 0% | No audit/language/notification/idempotency transition implementation proof yet |
| Business Phase 1 | Service catalog and product catalog | Not started | 0% | Catalog evidence and blueprint exist; Go business modules not implemented |
| Overall Laravel-to-Go transition | POS API migration | Early foundation | 15% | Docs, auth debug lane, and quality gates exist; POS domains are not implemented |

## Completed Work With Proof

- Docs consolidation and AI workflow rules exist under `docs/`.
- Codex, web AI, analysis, testing, evidence, and resume templates exist under `docs/templates/`.
- Web AI GitHub connector rules are documented as read-only by default.
- Manual debug login foundation is documented in `docs/handoffs/2026-06-06-manual-auth-login.md`.
- Manual debug accounts are documented as:
  - `admin@example.com` with password `12345678`;
  - `kasir@example.com` with password `12345678`.
- Quality and architecture audit scripts are documented as wired.

## Open Gaps

- Full Laravel source inventory is incomplete for many business domains.
- Laravel alter, foreign key, index, timestamp, and seed migrations are not fully inventoried.
- Product duplicate policy still needs an owner decision before final PostgreSQL indexes.
- Capability-control foundation is not implemented yet.
- Runtime DB proof for manual auth login is still incomplete.
- Security audit script is wired, but gosec passing proof is missing because the local toolchain/gosec run was blocked in the prior session.
- No POS domain PostgreSQL baseline has been accepted.
- No `servicecatalog` or `productcatalog` Go business module has implementation proof.

## Next Valid Active Step

Implement or complete `docs/blueprints/0010_capability_control_foundation.md` before exposing protected POS endpoints.

Minimum next-step proof:

- capability domain/usecase tests;
- disabled capability returns `403` before validation/usecase;
- route-to-capability audit script or placeholder proof;
- updated handoff and progress ledger.

## Handoff Requirement

Any Codex or web AI session that changes Laravel-to-Go transition docs, capability foundation, quality gates, or POS domain implementation must update this ledger or explicitly state why the ledger is unchanged.

The same session must create or update a handoff when durable work was done.

## Context Window Status

Current ledger update context status: enough context for one focused next implementation step after this docs step.
