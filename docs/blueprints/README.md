# Blueprints

This folder contains active implementation plans.

Rules:
- One blueprint owns one scope.
- Blueprints are not handoffs.
- Blueprints should stay readable as plans: keep ongoing logs in handoffs and progress ledgers.
- Closed blueprints may keep compact closeout summaries that link to proof-bearing handoffs or ledgers.
- Blueprints must define scope, risks, architecture impact, DB impact, API contract impact, capability keys, tests,
and step order.
- Do not implement from chat-only decisions.
