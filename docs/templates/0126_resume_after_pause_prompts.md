Use these prompts after a long break, a context reset, or a model switch.

docs/blueprints/README.md
docs/handoffs/README.md

THEN
- List active blueprints.
- List recent handoffs.
- Identify the likely active scope.
- Identify open GAP items.
- Recommend exactly one next active step.

RULES
- Do not edit files.
- Do not assume old chat memory is correct.
- Use file contents as proof.
```

## Restart A Specific Scope

```text
Resume this specific scope.

SCOPE
REPLACE_WITH_SCOPE

```

## No Handoff Exists Prompt

```text
No reliable handoff exists.

TASK
Rebuild context from repository docs only.

READ
docs/README.md
docs/AGENTS.md
docs/0001_index.md
docs/blueprints/

- safest next step;
- files that should not be touched yet.

Do not edit files in this pass.
