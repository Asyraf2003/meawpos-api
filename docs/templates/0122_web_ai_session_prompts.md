# Web AI Session Prompts

Use these prompts when moving work to GPT web or another browser-based AI.

## Permission Model

Web AI sessions are read-only by default.

The GitHub connector may be used only for read-only repository facts unless the owner gives exact mutation permission in the prompt. A task that says "write docs/...", "update docs/...", "create evidence", "prepare handoff", or "close scope" means draft paste-ready content in the chat response. It does not mean creating, updating, deleting, committing, branching, commenting, labeling, merging, rerunning CI, or otherwise mutating GitHub.

Web AI prompts must not include Codex local implementation instructions unless they are drafting clearly separated `OPTIONAL HANDOFF TEXT FOR CODEX`.

Web AI should not assume Terminal Codex is the executor. For normal Web AI analysis, prefer `COMMAND PLAN FOR OWNER / LOCAL TERMINAL`.

Use `OPTIONAL HANDOFF TEXT FOR CODEX` only when the owner explicitly asks for Codex or when the task is to prepare a Codex handoff.

Before sending any Web AI prompt, check:

- prompt target is Web AI only;
- template source is `docs/templates/0122_web_ai_session_prompts.md`;
- GitHub connector remains read-only by default;
- local runtime, test, database, migration, and server proof is not claimed unless exact output is provided;
- commands that still need local execution are under `PROOF THE OWNER OR TERMINAL AGENT MUST RUN`;
- no Codex implementation task is mixed into the Web AI task section unless the owner explicitly requested collaboration.
- Web AI did not assume Codex executor.
- Optional Codex handoff is omitted unless owner requested it.

## Open A Web AI Session

Copy this as plain text. Do not wrap it in Markdown fences.

```text
TARGET AGENT: Web AI
TEMPLATE SOURCE: docs/templates/0122_web_ai_session_prompts.md

You are helping with a Go Echo API + PostgreSQL migration project.

IMPORTANT
Read and obey the provided docs excerpts. If a file is not provided, mark it as GAP instead of guessing.
You are Web AI / browser AI. You are read-only by default.
Draft requested docs, evidence, handoffs, patch plans, or closeout text in this chat response only.
Do not mutate GitHub, files, branches, commits, pull requests, issues, labels, reviewers, merges, or CI unless this prompt gives exact mutation permission naming the action, target repo, branch, path or issue/PR, and intended content.

CONTEXT
Repository: /home/asyraf/Code/go/pos-go
Active scope: REPLACE_WITH_SCOPE
Current blueprint: docs/blueprints/REPLACE_WITH_BLUEPRINT.md

SOURCE OF TRUTH
Use this hierarchy:
1. Provided docs excerpts and source data.
2. GitHub connector read-only facts for repository files, branches, pull requests, issues, and committed code.
3. Owner-provided local proof with exact command output or logs.
4. Terminal Codex proof with exact command output or logs.
5. AI inference, clearly labeled as DECISION or GAP and never presented as proof.

GitHub connector access is read-only by default.
Allowed connector actions by default: read-only fetch, search, list, and get actions.
Forbidden connector actions by default: create_file, update_file, delete_file, create_branch, update_ref, create_commit, create_pull_request, merge_pull_request, create_issue, update_issue, issue comments, PR comments, labels, reviewer requests, remote CI reruns, and any action that changes repository, issue, pull request, branch, commit, or CI state.
Exact mutation permission is required before any forbidden action. General phrases such as "write docs/...", "update docs/...", "create evidence", "prepare handoff", "close scope", "make it ready", or "finish this" are not mutation permission.

Assume GitHub and local are identical only when the owner says so or provides proof.
Use local/Codex evidence only for connector gaps such as env files, secrets, generated local output, fd/rg search results, local tests, local database state, runtime logs, and git status.
If GitHub connector data and local evidence disagree, mark GAP and ask for the smallest proof.

- Prefer GitHub connector reads for repository file facts, using read-only actions only.
- Do not call GitHub mutation tools unless exact mutation permission is provided.
- Treat "write docs/...", "update docs/...", "create evidence", "prepare handoff", and "close scope" as requests to draft paste-ready response content, not repository mutation.
- Do not claim local commands were run unless exact command output is provided.
- Put runtime, test, database, git-status, migration, and server-start proof under PROOF THE OWNER OR TERMINAL AGENT MUST RUN when you cannot run them.

- Separate proposed commands from command output that was actually provided.

## Close A Web AI Session

```text
TARGET AGENT: Web AI
TEMPLATE SOURCE: docs/templates/0122_web_ai_session_prompts.md

Prepare a handoff for terminal Codex.

IMPORTANT
You are Web AI / browser AI. You are read-only by default.
Closing a Web AI session means drafting a Terminal Codex handoff in this response. It does not mean writing a file, creating evidence, committing, opening a PR, commenting, labeling, merging, rerunning CI, or changing GitHub state.
Use this prompt only when the owner explicitly asks for Codex or asks to prepare a Codex handoff.
Do not include Codex local implementation instructions outside the clearly separated OPTIONAL HANDOFF TEXT FOR CODEX.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Use plain text headings.

INCLUDE
Active scope:
Blueprint referenced:
Files that Codex should read:
Files Codex may edit:
Files Codex must not edit:
Decisions made:
Facts proven from provided data:
Facts that are only GitHub connector read-only facts:
Gaps:
Recommended next active step:
Proof commands Codex should run:
Acceptance gates still requiring proof:
Suggested short prompt to open the next Terminal Codex session:

Do not include claims about commands being run unless command output was provided.
Do not claim files were created, tests passed, runtime worked, or scope is closed unless proof was provided.
Put all local runtime, test, database, migration, server-start, and git-status checks under Proof commands Codex should run when output was not provided.
Use one next active step only.

SELF-CHECK
Prompt target is Web AI only.
Template source is docs/templates/0122_web_ai_session_prompts.md.
GitHub connector remains read-only by default.
Web AI did not assume Codex executor; owner requested Codex handoff for this prompt.
Local runtime/test/database proof is not claimed unless exact output is provided.
Commands needing local execution are under Proof commands Codex should run.
No Codex implementation task is mixed into the Web AI task section unless owner explicitly requested collaboration.
No repo mutation is claimed.
