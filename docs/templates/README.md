# Templates

This folder contains copyable documentation templates.

## Contents

- `0110_domain_scope_packet.md`: scope packet template for handing a bounded domain/API task to another AI, session, or human.
- `0120_prompt_authoring_rules.md`: copy-safe prompt writing rules, including ASCII and backtick guidance for web AI.
- `0121_codex_session_prompts.md`: terminal Codex start, implementation, review, and close-session prompts.
- `0122_web_ai_session_prompts.md`: browser AI open, continue, close, and cleanup prompts.
- `0123_analysis_and_review_prompts.md`: source-batch, domain migration, blueprint, and code review prompts.
- `0124_testing_and_proof_prompts.md`: test planning, proof running, and test-output interpretation prompts.
- `0125_data_capture_and_evidence_prompts.md`: prompts for turning external source or web AI output into organized docs.
- `0126_resume_after_pause_prompts.md`: prompts for long-pause resume, model switch, and missing-handoff recovery.

## Use This Folder When

- moving work between terminal Codex, GPT web, or another session;
- defining editable, read-only, and forbidden files;
- stating proof requirements for a scoped task;
- writing prompts that must be safe to copy from web AI;
- restarting work after a long pause or model switch;
- deciding where external analysis or source data should live in `docs/`.

Templates are starting points. Fill them with concrete files, rules, proof commands, and next steps before use.

## Work Cadence

For terminal coding agents, prefer one focused batch that completes the largest safe slice inside one active step. Ask for short progress updates and a compact final report.

For web AI, treat execution as draft-only by default: it should produce patch plans, exact CLI commands, docs text, evidence text, and handoff text. Terminal Codex or the owner runs commands and applies changes unless exact GitHub mutation permission is provided.

## Copy Safety

For web AI prompts:

- keep prompts in plain text when possible;
- use ASCII;
- avoid nested Markdown code fences;
- use uppercase placeholders like `REPLACE_WITH_SCOPE`;
- put long source data below a clear `SOURCE DATA` heading;
- keep proof commands separate from claims;
- keep GitHub connector use read-only by default;
- treat "write docs/...", "update docs/...", "create evidence", "prepare handoff", and "close scope" as draft response content unless exact mutation permission is given.
