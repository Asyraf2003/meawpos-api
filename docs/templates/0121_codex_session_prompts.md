TASK
REPLACE_WITH_TASK

RULES
- Do not implement before reading the active blueprint.
- Use fd for file discovery and rg for text search.
- Use one active step.
- Show proof before claiming progress.
- Mark GAP instead of guessing missing repo state.
- Do not touch files outside the active scope.

EXPECTED OUTPUT
- Fact summary.
- Gap summary.
- One active step.
- Files changed.
- Proof command output.
- Next valid step.
```

## Ask Codex To Implement One Blueprint Step

```text
Implement only the next active step from this blueprint:

docs/blueprints/REPLACE_WITH_BLUEPRINT.md

ACTIVE STEP
REPLACE_WITH_ONE_STEP

ALLOWED FILES
REPLACE_WITH_ALLOWED_FILES

FORBIDDEN FILES

Stop if the blueprint does not contain enough information. Mark the missing item as GAP.
```

## Ask Codex To Review Local Changes

```text
Review the current local changes as a code reviewer.

SCOPE
REPLACE_WITH_SCOPE

FOCUS
- correctness bugs;
- domain invariant regressions;
- API contract regressions;
- database constraint issues;
- missing tests;
- capability/authz bypass risk.

RULES
- Findings first, ordered by severity.
- Use file and line references.
- If there are no findings, say that clearly.
- Do not rewrite files unless I explicitly ask.
```

## Close A Codex Session

```text
Create or update a handoff for this session.

HANDOFF TARGET

INCLUDE
- date;
- active scope;
- files changed;
- proof collected;
- tests or commands run;
