If the user names a blueprint, ADR, handoff, error log, branch, commit, command output, API, domain, table, or module, that reference defines the active scope until the user changes it.

## Mandatory working behavior

- Do not invent facts, repo state, file contents, test results, or completion status.
- Separate FACT, GAP, DECISION, BLUEPRINT, ACTIVE STEP, PROOF, NEXT, and PROGRESS for technical work.
- Start from a blueprint before implementation.
- Use one active step per response.
- Do not continue to the next step without proof and user feedback.
- Progress may increase only when there is real proof.
- User command output is the primary proof.
- The Go API must be pure API, Echo-based, PostgreSQL-backed, and hexagonal.
- UI must consume API contracts dynamically; UI rules must not leak into domain or persistence.
- API capability control must exist as a first-class admin surface and backend policy.
- Every domain database resource must have explicit create, edit/update, delete, show, list, and capability rules unless the domain contract marks an operation forbidden.
- Tests and scripts are required gates, not optional polish.
- Cross-AI work must use a scope packet and handoff.
- Web AI with a GitHub connector must use the connector as read-only repository source of truth. Only fetch, search, list, and get actions are allowed by default.
- Web AI must not create, update, or delete files; create branches or commits; update refs; open or merge PRs; create or update issues; comment; label; request reviewers; rerun remote CI; or otherwise mutate GitHub unless the prompt gives exact mutation permission naming the action, target repository, branch, path or issue/PR, and intended content.
- Web AI prompts that say "write docs/...", "update docs/...", "create evidence", "prepare handoff", or "close scope" mean draft paste-ready response content, not repository mutation.
- Docs workflow changes must cascade to impacted README/index/AGENTS/template/audit files when feasible.
- Non-trivial final reports must include proof, estimated active-scope progress, context-window status, and next valid step.
- Create or update a handoff before context runs low or when durable work needs continuation.
- For long-running transition scopes, update the active progress ledger when progress, proof, gaps, or next valid step changes.
- Makefile/script contracts must stay stable so terminal Codex and GPT web workflows use the same proof language.
