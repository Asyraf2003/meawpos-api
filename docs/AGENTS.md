If the user names a blueprint, ADR, handoff, error log, branch, commit, command output, API, domain, table, or module, that reference defines the active scope until the user changes it.

## Mandatory working behavior

- Do not invent facts, repo state, file contents, test results, or completion status.
- Separate FACT, GAP, DECISION, BLUEPRINT, ACTIVE STEP, PROOF, NEXT, and PROGRESS for technical work.
- Start from a blueprint before implementation.
- Use one active step per response.
- Do not continue to the next step without proof and user feedback.
- Progress may increase only when there is real proof.
- User command output is the primary proof.
- The Go API must be pure API, Echo-based, PostgreSQL-backed, and hexagonal.
- UI must consume API contracts dynamically; UI rules must not leak into domain or persistence.
- API capability control must exist as a first-class admin surface and backend policy.
- Every domain database resource must have explicit create, edit/update, delete, show, list, and capability rules unless the domain contract marks an operation forbidden.
- Tests and scripts are required gates, not optional polish.
- Cross-AI work must use a scope packet and handoff.
- Makefile/script contracts must stay stable so terminal Codex and GPT web workflows use the same proof language.
