## Date

2026-06-08

## Active Scope

Plan ServiceCatalog implementation slice 1.

## Files Changed

- `docs/blueprints/0025_servicecatalog_implementation_slice_1.md`
- `docs/handoffs/2026-06-08-servicecatalog-implementation-slice-1-plan.md`

## Decision

ServiceCatalog implementation should start with domain and usecase contracts only.

## Forbidden In This Slice

- HTTP transport
- PostgreSQL migrations
- PostgreSQL repositories
- Capability seed migrations
- Route registration
- ProductCatalog
- Inventory

## Proof Required After Implementation

- `go test ./internal/modules/servicecatalog/...`
- `make verify`

## Next Valid Active Step

Review and accept or adjust `docs/blueprints/0025_servicecatalog_implementation_slice_1.md`.

Do not implement until the blueprint is accepted.

## Progress

ServiceCatalog domain contract: 100%.

ServiceCatalog implementation slice 1 plan: 70%.

Business Phase 1 implementation: 0%.

Overall Laravel-to-Go transition: 20%.
