# Handoff: ServiceCatalog Domain Contract Accepted

## Date

2026-06-08

## Active Scope

Accept `docs/blueprints/0024_servicecatalog_domain_contract.md`.

## Files Changed

- `docs/blueprints/0024_servicecatalog_domain_contract.md`
- `docs/evidence/0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md`
- `docs/handoffs/2026-06-08-servicecatalog-domain-contract-accepted.md`

## Decision

ServiceCatalog domain contract is accepted.

## Accepted Contract Summary

```text
domain = servicecatalog
aggregate root = ServiceCatalogItem
source table = service_catalog_items
delete policy = forbidden physical delete
lifecycle = active/inactive
normalization = server-owned
initial permissions = service_catalog.read, service_catalog.manage
idempotency = not required for first implementation
```

## Accepted Capability Keys

```text
service_catalog.list
service_catalog.lookup
service_catalog.show
service_catalog.create
service_catalog.update
service_catalog.activate
service_catalog.deactivate
```

## Proof Collected Before Acceptance

- ServiceCatalog blueprint exists.
- ServiceCatalog handoff exists.
- Ledger references `docs/blueprints/0024_servicecatalog_domain_contract.md`.
- `make verify` passed after blueprint creation.

## Gaps Still Open

- Full ServiceCatalog Laravel source is not available yet.
- Exact seed row source needs proof before Go seed migration.
- No ServiceCatalog Go implementation proof exists.
- No ServiceCatalog PostgreSQL migration proof exists.
- No ServiceCatalog capability seed proof exists.
- ProductCatalog duplicate policy remains unresolved.

## Next Valid Active Step

Plan ServiceCatalog implementation slice 1.

Do not implement yet.

## Estimated Scope Progress Percentage

ServiceCatalog domain contract: 100%.

Business Phase 1 implementation: 0%.

Overall Laravel-to-Go transition: 20%.

## Context Window Status

Enough context remains for ServiceCatalog implementation slice planning.
