# Handoff: Transition Progress Ledger

## Date

2026-06-07

## Active Scope

Create the Laravel-to-Go transition progress ledger and cascade the required documentation references.

## Current Branch Or Source Snapshot

Local workspace: `/home/asyraf/Code/go/pos-go`

Git status before edits was clean by `git status --short`.

## Files Forbidden To Touch

No Go source, migrations, runtime config, or production secrets should be touched by the next session unless the owner changes scope.

## Blueprint Referenced

```text
docs/blueprints/0012_laravel_to_go_api_transition_master_plan.md
docs/blueprints/0010_capability_control_foundation.md
docs/blueprints/0020_catalog_foundation_migration.md
```

## ADR And Rules Referenced

```text
docs/0001_index.md
docs/0002_decision_policy.md
docs/0003_session_start_protocol.md
docs/workflow/0070_docs_go_workflow.md
docs/workflow/0071_handoff_protocol.md
```

## Decisions Made

- A dedicated transition progress ledger is required for long-running Laravel-to-Go migration status.
- The ledger lives under `docs/evidence/` because it is proof-linked status.
- The protocol lives under `docs/workflow/` because it controls how future sessions update progress.
- The active Laravel-to-Go ledger is `docs/evidence/0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md`.
- Protected POS endpoints still must wait for capability-control proof.

## Proof Collected

AI rules audit passed:

```text
bash scripts/audit_ai_rules.sh
```

Visible result:

```text
[PASS] AI rules audit passed
```

## Tests Or Commands Run

Before edits:

```text
git status --short
rg -n "Stage 0|Stage 1|Stage 2|Stage 3|servicecatalog|productcatalog|capability|handoff|progress|percent|percentage|Web AI|GitHub connector|source of truth" docs/blueprints docs/workflow docs/templates docs/handoffs docs/evidence docs/README.md docs/AGENTS.md docs/0001_index.md
sed -n ... docs rule, workflow, blueprint, evidence, and handoff files
fd . docs -t f
```

After edits:

```text
bash scripts/audit_ai_rules.sh
```

Result:

```text
[PASS] AI rules audit passed
```

## Gaps Still Open

- No capability-control implementation proof yet.
- No passing gosec/security audit proof yet.
- No runtime DB proof for manual debug login yet.
- No POS PostgreSQL baseline proof yet.
- No `servicecatalog` or `productcatalog` Go implementation proof yet.

## Next Valid Active Step

Implement or complete `docs/blueprints/0010_capability_control_foundation.md`.

Do not start `servicecatalog` or `productcatalog` protected endpoints until capability-control proof exists.

## Estimated Scope Progress Percentage

Transition progress ledger scope: 100%.

Overall Laravel-to-Go transition: 15%.

## Estimated Context-Window Status

Enough context remains for one focused implementation step after this docs handoff.
