- `docs/evidence/0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md`
- `docs/handoffs/2026-06-08-capability-control-closeout.md`

## Files Forbidden To Touch

- POS CRUD implementation
- `servicecatalog` implementation
- `productcatalog` implementation
- Future POS business capability seeds before accepted domain contracts
- Admin capability HTTP behavior
- Auth behavior redesign
- Production secrets

## Blueprint Referenced

- `docs/blueprints/0010_capability_control_foundation.md`

## Decisions Made

- Capability-control foundation is closed.
- Current protected routes have capability metadata, runtime guards, route-to-capability audit coverage, and route-level disabled proof.
- `make verify` includes route capability audit and passes.
- First POS business-domain blueprint/domain contract may start next.
- POS CRUD implementation remains blocked.
- Future POS business capability seeds must wait for accepted domain contracts.

## Proof Collected

Focused tests:

```text
go test ./internal/transport/http/middleware/... ./internal/modules/auth/transport/http/... ./internal/app/bootstrap/...
ok   pos-go/internal/transport/http/middleware    (cached)
ok   pos-go/internal/modules/auth/transport/http  (cached)
ok   pos-go/internal/app/bootstrap                (cached)
```

Route capability audit:

```text
bash scripts/audit_route_capabilities.sh
== route capability audit ==
manifest: scripts/config/route_capabilities.tsv

checked route capability rows: 6
[PASS] route capability audit passed
```

DB migration status:

```text
make db-status
[APPLIED] 0006_capability_control.up.sql
[APPLIED] 0007_seed_existing_protected_capabilities.up.sql
[APPLIED] 0008_seed_capability_manage_permission.up.sql
```

Aggregate verification:

```text
make verify
Summary:
  Gosec  : dev
  Files  : 97
  Lines  : 3978
  Nosec  : 0
  Issues : 0

[PASS] gosec audit passed

== aggregate audit summary ==
[PASS] go test ./...
[PASS] go vet audit
[PASS] format audit
[PASS] AI rules audit
[PASS] file size audit
[PASS] hexagonal import audit
[PASS] route capability audit
[PASS] security gosec audit

[PASS] aggregate audit passed
```

## Tests Or Commands Run

- `go test ./internal/transport/http/middleware/... ./internal/modules/auth/transport/http/... ./internal/app/bootstrap/...`
- `bash scripts/audit_route_capabilities.sh`
- `make db-status`
- `make verify`

## Gaps Still Open

- Full Laravel source inventory is incomplete for many business domains.
- Laravel alter, foreign key, index, timestamp, and seed migrations are not fully inventoried.
- Product duplicate policy still needs an owner decision before final PostgreSQL indexes.
- Runtime DB proof for manual auth login is still incomplete.
- No POS domain PostgreSQL baseline has been accepted.
- No first POS business-domain blueprint/domain contract has been accepted yet.
- No `servicecatalog` or `productcatalog` Go business module has implementation proof.

## Next Valid Active Step

Start the first POS business-domain blueprint/domain contract.

Do not start POS CRUD implementation.

Do not add future POS business capability seeds before accepted domain contracts.

## Estimated Scope Progress Percentage

Capability-control foundation: 100%.

Stage 1 Go quality foundation: 90%.

Overall Laravel-to-Go transition: 20%.

## Estimated Context-Window Status

Enough context remains to start the first POS business-domain blueprint/domain contract in a new focused scope.
