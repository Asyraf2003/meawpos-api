# Handoff: Docs Quality Feedback Crosscheck

## Feedback Crosscheck

| Dimension | External Rating | Repo Fact | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Folder structure | 9/10 | Folder roles and README coverage are explicit. | No change. |
| AI governance | 9/10 | Bootstrap, proof, one-step, and prompt-channel rules exist. | No change. |
| ADR quality | 8/10 | ADR files exist and are linked by topic, but proof completion was not indexed in one place. | Added ADR implementation proof index. |
| Blueprint quality | 7/10 | `0010` contains closeout proof and step completion markers. | Added blueprint/log boundary rule instead of rewriting closed proof. |
| Handoff consistency | 9/10 | Handoffs use consistent fields. | No change. |
| Redundant rules | 6/10 | Duplication is partly intentional cascade for AI bootstrap. | No removal; cascade remains intentional. |
| Onboarding ease | 6/10 | README had full read order but no quick reference. | Added 5-minute quick reference. |
| Evidence completeness | 7/10 | Auth runtime evidence file was visibly incomplete. | Added evidence status index and marked incomplete file gaps. |
| Template specificity | Not scored in table | Domain scope packet was placeholder-only. | Added concrete ServiceCatalog slice example. |

## Decisions Made

- Treat rule duplication as an intentional cascade unless future drift is proven.
- Do not rewrite closed capability blueprint `0010` because it now serves as a compact closeout pointer with proof links.
- Add a workflow rule that ongoing logs belong in handoffs or ledgers.
- Add a quick onboarding reference to improve first-pass navigation.
- Add evidence status labels so incomplete evidence is not misread as complete proof.
- Add one concrete domain scope packet example using accepted ServiceCatalog slice 1 facts.
- Add ADR implementation proof index and link it from ADR README, evidence README, and the active transition ledger.

## Proof Collected

```text
rg -n "5-Minute Quick Reference|Evidence Status Index|Incomplete local runtime evidence|Blueprints should|Concrete Example: ServiceCatalog Slice 1|Docs quality feedback crosscheck|does not increase Laravel-to-Go implementation progress|This evidence file is incomplete" docs/README.md docs/evidence docs/workflow docs/blueprints docs/templates docs/handoffs
```

Result:

```text
docs/README.md includes 5-Minute Quick Reference.
docs/evidence/README.md includes Evidence Status Index.
docs/evidence/2026-06-06-auth-runtime-local-dev.md marks the evidence file incomplete and lists missing proof.
docs/workflow/0070_docs_go_workflow.md and docs/blueprints/README.md clarify blueprint/log boundaries.
docs/templates/0110_domain_scope_packet.md includes a concrete ServiceCatalog slice 1 example.
docs/evidence/0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md records the docs quality improvement without increasing implementation progress.
docs/evidence/0004_adr_implementation_proof_index.md maps accepted ADRs to implementation proof status.
```

```text
make verify
```

Result:

```text
[PASS] go test ./...
[PASS] go vet audit
[PASS] format audit
[PASS] AI rules audit
[PASS] file size audit
[PASS] hexagonal import audit
[PASS] route capability audit
[PASS] security gosec audit
[PASS] aggregate audit passed
```

Gosec summary:

```text
Files: 112
Lines: 4659
Nosec: 0
Issues: 0
```

## Tests Or Commands Run

```text
rg -n "5-Minute Quick Reference|Evidence Status Index|Incomplete local runtime evidence|Blueprints should|Concrete Example: ServiceCatalog Slice 1|Docs quality feedback crosscheck|does not increase Laravel-to-Go implementation progress|This evidence file is incomplete" docs/README.md docs/evidence docs/workflow docs/blueprints docs/templates docs/handoffs
rg -n "ADR Implementation Proof Index|0009.*Partial|0012.*Partial|8.5/10|Proof Tracking" docs/adr docs/evidence docs/handoffs
make verify
```

## Gaps

- ADR completion proof mapping is now indexed in `docs/evidence/0004_adr_implementation_proof_index.md`.
- Full evidence content audit beyond status labeling remains possible.
- Rule cascade duplication remains by design unless future drift appears.
- ADR `0009` debug auth lane remains partial until manual auth runtime proof is completed.
- ADR `0012` API output contract centralization remains partial until response/error envelope proof covers every API surface.

## Next Valid Active Step

Plan the next ServiceCatalog implementation slice after `docs/blueprints/0025_servicecatalog_implementation_slice_1.md`.

## Estimated Scope Progress Percentage

Docs quality feedback crosscheck scope: 100%.

Laravel-to-Go transition: unchanged by docs quality changes. Current active ledger estimate is 22%.

## Estimated Context-Window Status

Enough context remains to run proof and report results.
