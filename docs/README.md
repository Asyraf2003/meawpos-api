# docs

## What This Is

`docs/` is the single documentation root for the Go Echo API + PostgreSQL project.

This folder is the first place to read before planning, coding, reviewing, or asking an AI assistant to work in the Go API repository.

It explains:

- how AI must work;
- how humans should navigate the docs;
- how the Go API architecture is constrained;
- how domain CRUD must be designed;
- how API capabilities can be enabled or disabled;
- how PostgreSQL, Echo, tests, and scripts must be handled.

## Why This Exists

The Go API project must stay cleaner than the legacy transition docs.

The goal is not only clean code. The goal is clean work:

- no overlapping blueprint and handoff;
- no archive document overriding active rules;
- no hidden architecture decision in chat;
- no endpoint without capability control;
- no domain mutation without transaction, audit, authorization, and tests;
- no claim of completion without proof.

## Project Direction

The target project is:

- Go;
- Echo HTTP framework;
- pure API, no server-rendered UI ownership;
- PostgreSQL;
- hexagonal architecture;
- dynamic UI consumption through API contracts and capability metadata;
- strict test and script gates.

## 5-Minute Quick Reference

Architecture direction:

```text
Echo HTTP -> usecase -> domain -> ports -> PostgreSQL adapter
```

First local command when checking the current repo state:

```bash
make verify
```

Current transition status and next valid step live in:

```text
docs/evidence/0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md
```

Five rules most likely to prevent bad work:

- do not invent facts when a file or command output can be inspected;
- use exactly one active step;
- do not claim progress without proof;
- do not expose protected API behavior without capability metadata and runtime capability check;
- keep business rules out of Echo handlers, SQL builders, and UI contracts.

## Core Rule Summary

Before work:

- define active scope;
- inspect facts;
- mark gaps;
- write or read the blueprint;
- choose one active step;
- state proof needed.

During work:

- keep package boundaries strict;
- keep domain logic outside Echo handlers;
- keep SQL inside PostgreSQL adapters;
- keep public API contracts stable;
- keep capability control in the official registry/policy path;
- keep tests close to the risk.

After work:

- show proof;
- report progress only from proof;
- write handoff only when needed;
- do not move to the next step without feedback.
- for non-trivial work, report estimated active-scope progress and context-window status.

## Cross-AI Work Pattern

When work moves between terminal Codex and GPT web, use a scope packet.

The packet must include:

- active domain or API;
- files included;
- files forbidden to touch;
- current blueprint;
- relevant rules;
- desired output;
- proof required;
- handoff target.

The receiving AI may only work inside that packet unless the owner changes scope.

Use `templates/0120_prompt_authoring_rules.md` before writing copyable prompts.

Use `templates/0121_codex_session_prompts.md` for terminal Codex sessions.

Use `templates/0122_web_ai_session_prompts.md` for GPT web or another browser-based AI.

Before drafting any next-session prompt, select exactly one target agent and exactly one matching template source. Do not combine Terminal Codex and Web AI instructions in one prompt unless the owner explicitly requests a collaboration packet. If the target agent is missing, ask one concise clarification question.

Web AI is read-only analysis/planning by default and should normally produce command plans for owner/local terminal execution. Terminal Codex is the local CLI implementation agent. Do not assume either agent is the executor for the other unless the owner explicitly requests that execution channel or a collaboration packet.

Normal Web AI analysis must omit Codex handoff text unless the owner explicitly requests Codex. The default terminal execution channel for Web AI command plans is owner/local terminal. Every `NEXT` or handoff section must name exactly one next execution channel.

When GPT web has a GitHub connector, the connector is the read-only source of truth for repository files, branches, pull requests, issues, and committed code. Web AI connector access is read-only by default: only fetch, search, list, and get actions are allowed unless exact mutation permission is given.

Do not ask web AI to create, update, or delete files; create branches or commits; update refs; open or merge PRs; create or update issues; comment; label; request reviewers; rerun remote CI; or otherwise mutate GitHub unless the prompt explicitly names the mutation action, target repository, branch, path or issue/PR, and intended content. Phrases such as "write docs/...", "update docs/...", "create evidence", "prepare handoff", and "close scope" mean draft paste-ready content in the response, not repository mutation.

Use local Codex evidence for connector gaps only, such as `.env`, secrets, generated local output, `fd`/`rg` search results, local tests, local database state, and runtime logs.

If GitHub connector facts and local evidence disagree, mark `GAP` and ask for the smallest proof.

When Laravel source data is missing, ask for the smallest specific source batch by folder, file, route, migration, seeder, test, or command output. When an ADR or owner decision is needed, ask a concise question with 2-3 options, include plus/minus tradeoffs, and put the recommended option first when there is a clear recommendation.

## Documentation Cascade Rule

When a docs change affects how future sessions start, continue, verify, or hand off, update the impacted chain in the same step when feasible:

- `docs/README.md`;
- `docs/AGENTS.md`;
- `docs/0001_index.md`;
- local folder `README.md`;
- related workflow/template docs;
- `scripts/audit_ai_rules.sh` when the rule or file becomes mandatory.

Do not leave a new mandatory workflow rule only in chat.

For long-running work or when context is running low, create or update a handoff in `docs/handoffs/` with files changed, proof, gaps, next step, estimated progress percentage, and context-window status.

For long-running transition scopes, update the active progress ledger when progress, proof, gaps, or next valid step changes. The active Laravel-to-Go ledger is `docs/evidence/0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md`.

Before continuing Laravel-to-Go, capability-control, quality-gate, or POS domain work, read the active ledger and the latest related handoff. The ledger owns current progress, current gaps, and the next valid active step.

## Architecture Rule In One Line

```text
Echo -> application use case -> domain rules -> ports -> PostgreSQL adapter
```

Do not reverse this direction.

## API Capability Rule In One Line

Every protected API operation must have a capability key and must be controllable from the capability control surface.

Example:

```text
products.create
products.update
products.delete
products.show
products.list
```

Disabled capability means the request must stop before the use case runs.

## Domain Rule In One Line

Every database-backed domain must declare create, update, delete, show, and list behavior, or explicitly document why an operation is forbidden.

## Documentation Discipline

Documents must not overlap roles.

- Standards live in `docs/`.
- Blueprints describe planned work.
- ADRs record accepted decisions.
- Handoffs continue sessions.
- Evidence records proof.
- Archive is historical and cannot override active rules.
- Each folder has a local `README.md` so readers can enter from any part of the documentation tree.

## For AI Assistants

Do not start with implementation.

Start with:

- FACT;
- GAP;
- DECISION;
- BLUEPRINT;
- ACTIVE STEP;
- PROOF;
- NEXT;
- PROGRESS.

If a source file, command output, or contract is missing, mark it as GAP instead of guessing.

## For Humans

Use this folder as the rulebook before asking for Go API work.

When asking for a change, name the active domain or API clearly, for example:

```text
Work on products CRUD capability blueprint.
```

or:

```text
Implement products.show from the accepted blueprint.
```

That named scope becomes the active scope until changed.

## Critical Local Commands

The future Go repository should keep these command names stable:

```bash
make verify
make test
make test-api
make test-db
make lint
make arch
make seed
make security
```

Exact implementation may change, but command meaning must stay documented in `scripts/0090_makefile_and_scripts.md`.
