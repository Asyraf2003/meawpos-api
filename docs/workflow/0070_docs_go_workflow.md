# Docs Go Workflow

## Purpose

Keep documentation clean and prevent handoff, blueprint, ADR, archive, and standards from overwriting each other.

## Document Classes

- `docs/`: canonical AI and engineering rules.
- `docs/blueprints/`: active implementation plans.
- `docs/adr/`: accepted decisions that change architecture or contract.
- `docs/handoffs/`: session-to-session continuation notes.
- `docs/evidence/`: command output summaries and proof references.
- `docs/archive/`: old material that is no longer active.

If the future Go repo uses different paths, it must preserve these document roles.

## Blueprint Rules

Blueprints must be scoped to one domain, capability, migration, or architecture decision.

Blueprints must not be used as handoffs.

## Handoff Rules

Handoffs must state:

- last active scope;
- files changed;
- proof collected;
- tests run;
- open gaps;
- next valid active step.

Handoffs must not silently change decisions.

## Archive Rules

Archive is read-only historical context unless the user explicitly revives it.

Archive must not override active rules, ADRs, blueprints, source code, or command output.

## Naming Rules

Use numbered files for ordered standards and blueprints:

```text
0001_index.md
0002_decision_policy.md
0010_domain_name_blueprint.md
```

Do not reuse numbers for different meanings.

## Cleanliness Rules

- One document owns one purpose.
- Every folder under `docs/` should have a `README.md` that explains the folder role, its active files, and when to use it.
- No duplicate active blueprint for the same scope.
- No "latest final v2 fixed" naming.
- No completion status without proof reference.
- No decision hidden only in chat.
