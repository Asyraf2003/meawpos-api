# Transition Progress Ledger Protocol

## Purpose

Long migrations need one current progress ledger in addition to blueprints, evidence, and handoffs.

The ledger keeps the owner, terminal Codex, web AI, and future sessions aligned on:

- accepted stage order;
- current stage status;
- proof behind progress percentages;
- open gaps;
- next valid active step;
- handoff and README cascade requirements.

## Applies To

Use this protocol for long-running transition scopes, especially:

- Laravel-to-Go API transition;
- multi-stage domain migration;
- capability-control foundation;
- quality/security gate rollout;
- cross-AI work that spans more than one session.

## Ledger Location

Current transition progress ledgers live under `docs/evidence/` because they are proof-linked status documents.

The active Laravel-to-Go ledger is:

```text
docs/evidence/0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md
```

## Ledger Rules

Every progress ledger must include:

- date updated;
- active blueprint;
- linked handoffs;
- linked evidence;
- stage table;
- per-stage status;
- proof reference for every non-zero progress estimate;
- open gaps;
- next valid active step;
- context-window status when updated by an AI session.

## Progress Rules

Progress may increase only from proof.

Valid proof includes:

- inspected source files;
- inspected docs;
- command output;
- test output;
- user-provided runtime output;
- accepted ADR or blueprint decision.

Plans alone do not increase progress.

When a stage has partial implementation but missing runtime or test proof, mark it partial and list the missing proof.

## Cascade Rules

When the ledger is created or materially updated, update the impacted chain when feasible:

- `docs/README.md`;
- `docs/AGENTS.md`;
- `docs/0001_index.md`;
- `docs/workflow/README.md`;
- `docs/evidence/README.md`;
- `docs/handoffs/README.md`;
- `scripts/audit_ai_rules.sh` if the ledger becomes mandatory.

## Handoff Rules

After durable progress on a long-running transition scope, create or update a handoff under `docs/handoffs/`.

The handoff must point to the current progress ledger and state:

- what changed;
- proof run;
- gaps still open;
- estimated active-scope progress;
- estimated context-window status;
- next valid active step.

## Web AI Rules

Web AI with a GitHub connector stays read-only by default.

If web AI updates progress, it must draft paste-ready ledger or handoff text in the chat response unless the owner gives exact mutation permission.

Connector facts and local terminal facts can differ. If they do, mark `GAP` and request the smallest proof.

## Stop Condition

Do not start a new Laravel-to-Go implementation stage when the ledger says the required foundation proof is missing.

For protected POS API implementation, capability-control proof is required before exposing endpoints.
