# ProductCatalog LookupProducts Skeleton Progress Handoff

## Date

2026-06-10

## Active Scope

ProductCatalog implementation slice 1.

Blueprint:

```text
docs/blueprints/0029_productcatalog_implementation_slice_1.md
```

Scope remains limited to:

```text
internal/modules/productcatalog/domain
internal/modules/productcatalog/ports
internal/modules/productcatalog/usecase
```

## FACT

LookupProducts contract and constructor/skeleton are now locally implemented and remote-visible through GitHub connector.

Implemented files:

```text
internal/modules/productcatalog/usecase/lookup_products_contract.go
internal/modules/productcatalog/usecase/lookup_products.go
```

Implemented skeleton only:

- LookupProductsQuery
- LookupProductsResult
- LookupProductsItem
- LookupProducts usecase type with ports.ProductReader dependency
- NewLookupProducts

LookupProducts reader error propagation and query forwarding are implemented and remote-visible through GitHub connector.

Focused proof passed:

```text
go test ./internal/modules/productcatalog/...
```

Line-count checkpoint passed:

```text
wc -l internal/modules/productcatalog/usecase/lookup_products*.go
```

## GAP

LookupProducts success mapping and empty-list behavior are not implemented or behavior-tested yet.

Remaining ProductCatalog slice 1 read-query work:

- Add remaining LookupProducts behavior one failing test at a time.
- Add ListProductVersions contract and behavior later.

## DECISION

Stop LookupProducts work after reader error propagation until the next behavior-test step.

Do not start PostgreSQL adapter, migrations, Echo HTTP transport, presenters, route registration, capability seed, inventory stock mutation, UI, or ProductCatalog runtime HTTP slice.

## PROOF

Focused ProductCatalog proof passed after LookupProducts skeleton creation.

Progress ledger was updated after focused proof:

```text
Business Phase 1: 40%
Overall Laravel-to-Go transition: 31%
LookupProducts contract, constructor/skeleton, reader error propagation, and query forwarding are remote-visible through GitHub connector with focused proof.
```

## NEXT

Execution channel: owner/local terminal.

Next valid implementation step:

Add the next failing LookupProducts behavior test only.

Do not start ProductCatalog PostgreSQL, Echo/runtime, migrations, capability seed, inventory mutation, UI, ProductCatalog runtime HTTP slice, or ListProductVersions.

## PROGRESS

ProductCatalog domain: 100%.

ProductCatalog ports: 96%.

CreateProduct usecase behavior: 97%.

UpdateProduct usecase behavior: 100% locally proven.

SoftDeleteProduct usecase behavior: 100% locally proven and connector-validated.

RestoreProduct usecase behavior: 100% locally proven and connector-validated.

GetProductDetail usecase behavior: 100% locally proven and connector-validated.

ListProducts usecase behavior: 100% locally proven and connector-visible.

LookupProducts query forwarding: 100% locally proven and connector-validated.

ProductCatalog slice 1 overall: 99% locally proven.

Business Phase 1: 40%.

Overall transition: 31%.

## CONTEXT WINDOW STATUS

Enough context remains to continue ProductCatalog slice 1 into LookupProducts success mapping behavior.

Forbidden scope remains out:

```text
PostgreSQL adapter
migrations
Echo HTTP transport
presenters
route registration
capability seed
inventory stock mutation
UI
ProductCatalog runtime HTTP slice
```
