# ProductCatalog Runtime Smoke Proof Closeout Handoff

Date: 2026-06-14

Target agent for next session: Terminal Codex.

Template source for next prompt: `docs/templates/0121_codex_session_prompts.md`.

## Active Scope

```

## FACT

ProductCatalog runtime smoke proof is locally proven.

The smoke proof covered:

- local PostgreSQL migrations through `0013_seed_product_catalog_permissions_capabilities.up.sql`;
- Echo server started with `AUTH_DEBUG_ENABLED=true` on port `18081`;
- health endpoint returned `200` with `status=ok`;
- manual login returned `200` and access/refresh tokens were present;
- unauthenticated `GET /api/products` returned `401` with `authentication_required`;
- authenticated ProductCatalog `list`, `lookup`, `create`, and `show` routes succeeded;
- direct `products` table row check returned count `1`;
- reversible disable of `product_catalog.list` produced `403 capability_disabled`;
- capability was re-enabled and final list returned `200`;
- server process was manually stopped and port `18081` was verified closed.

Raw tokens, auth payloads, database credentials, and secrets were not written to docs.

## PROOF

Runtime proof summary:

```text
make db-migrate
[PASS] db migrate completed

make db-status
[APPLIED] migrations through 0013_seed_product_catalog_permissions_capabilities.up.sql

health_status=200
health_status_field=ok

manual_login status=200 access_token_present=True refresh_token_present=True
unauth_products status=401 success=False error_code=authentication_required has_meta=True
list_products status=200 success=True has_meta=True
lookup_products status=200 success=True has_meta=True
create_product status=201 success=True id_present=True kode_barang_present=True has_meta=True
show_product status=200 success=True id_match=True kode_barang_present=True status_field=active has_meta=True
db_product_row table=products count=1
disable_capability key=product_catalog.list status=200 enabled=False
list_products_capability_disabled status=403 success=False error_code=capability_disabled has_meta=True
enable_capability key=product_catalog.list status=200 enabled=True
list_products_after_reenable status=200 success=True
[PASS] product catalog runtime smoke proof passed
```

Docs closeout verification is expected to run after this handoff update:

```text
make verify
```

## GAP

Product inventory/stock API is not implemented.

ProductCatalog audit/outbox persistence is not implemented.

Shared success envelope centralization is not implemented.

ADR `0012` output contract centralization remains partial across all API surfaces.

ADR `0009` full debug auth runtime closeout remains partial; this smoke only proves manual login token issuance as part of the ProductCatalog runtime path.

Runtime language/output policy remains open.

Extended Laravel ProductCatalog filters remain unexposed.

Router/server/bootstrap cleanup remains a future blueprint candidate, not a blocker for the next slice.

## Decisions Made

ProductCatalog runtime smoke proof is marked locally proven in the active ledger.

ProductCatalog catalog API remains closed locally for pure API scope.

Product/inventory area remains partial and must not be called fully closed.

The next valid slice is shared success envelope and ADR `0012` output contract centralization.

## PROGRESS

ProductCatalog runtime smoke proof: 100% locally proven.

Estimated ProductCatalog full transition: 84%.

Estimated Business Phase 1: 60%.

Estimated overall Laravel-to-Go transition: 41%.

## NEXT

Execution channel: Terminal Codex.

One next active step:

```text
Shared success envelope and ADR 0012 output contract centralization.
```

```

Files the next agent must not edit unless the owner changes scope:

```text
migrations/
internal/modules/productcatalog/domain
internal/modules/productcatalog/usecase
internal/platform/postgres
```

Proof commands for the next slice:

```text
go test ./internal/transport/http/response/...
go test ./internal/modules/productcatalog/transport/http/... ./internal/modules/servicecatalog/transport/http/... ./internal/modules/capability/transport/http/... ./internal/modules/system/transport/http/... ./internal/modules/auth/transport/http/...
bash scripts/audit_hexagonal.sh
bash scripts/audit_route_capabilities.sh
make verify
```

## CONTEXT WINDOW STATUS

Current closeout context status: fresh after interrupted runtime smoke proof was resumed. Runtime proof is recorded; next session can start from ADR `0012` without rerunning the ProductCatalog smoke unless a concrete gap is found.
