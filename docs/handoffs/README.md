# Handoffs

This folder contains current session continuation notes only.

Use the active transition ledger for current state first:

```text
docs/evidence/0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md
```

Closed or historical handoffs live in:

```text
docs/archive/handoffs-closed/
```

Archive index:

```text
docs/archive/handoffs-closed/README.md
```

## Current

-  2026-06-14-supplier-postgres-persistence-migration-only.md: Supplier PostgreSQL persistence checkpoint through List/Lookup and query-plan proof; next active step is connector validation and final closeout.
-  2026-06-14-supplier-implementation-slice-1-closeout.md: Supplier domain/ports/usecase closeout context and proof summary.
- `2026-06-14-productcatalog-runtime-smoke-proof-closeout.md`: ProductCatalog runtime smoke proof closeout context and next ADR `0012` output-contract slice pointer.
- `2026-06-08-servicecatalog-runtime-capability-implementation.md`: latest ServiceCatalog runtime/capability closeout context and next planning-only scope.
- `2026-06-08-servicecatalog-runtime-capability-blueprint-accepted.md`: accepted blueprint 0027 context retained until the next scoped session prompt is prepared.

Superseded ProductCatalog implementation handoff history is archived under `docs/archive/handoffs-closed/` and summarized by the active transition ledger.

## Pending / Needs Follow-Up

- `2026-06-06-auth-runtime-local-dev.md`: auth runtime proof remains incomplete; keep visible until ADR `0009` runtime proof is closed or superseded.
- `2026-06-09-cli-command-formatter-rules.md`: CLI formatter rule proof remains a workflow follow-up until its local audit proof is recorded or superseded.

## Archive Policy

Move a handoff to `docs/archive/handoffs-closed/` when all conditions are true:

- the scope is closed with proof or clearly historical;
- the proof is summarized in the active ledger, evidence history, or archive index;
- no current next step depends on scanning the full handoff;
- the owner approves early archive or the handoff is old enough under project policy.

Archived handoffs are historical only and cannot override active ledgers, blueprints, ADRs, source code, or command output.

## Required Handoff Fields

Each active handoff must include:

- active scope;
- files changed;
- proof collected;
- tests run;
- open gaps;
- next valid active step;
- estimated scope progress percentage;
- estimated context-window status.
