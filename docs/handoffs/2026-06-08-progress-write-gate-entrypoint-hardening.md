# Handoff: Progress Write Gate Entrypoint Hardening

## Date

2026-06-08

## Active Scope

Harden docs entrypoints so the Progress Write Gate is visible before future AI sessions reach deeper template documents.

## FACT

- `docs/templates/0122_web_ai_session_prompts.md` already defines Progress Write Gate.
- `docs/workflow/0072_transition_progress_ledger_protocol.md` already defines Progress Update Gate.
- This hardening adds Progress Write Gate reminders to:
  - `docs/README.md`
  - `docs/AGENTS.md`
  - `docs/0003_session_start_protocol.md`
- `scripts/audit_ai_rules.sh` now checks stable anchors for those entrypoint reminders.

## PROOF

Owner-provided local proof on 2026-06-08:

```text
bash scripts/audit_ai_rules.sh

Result:

[PASS] AI rules audit passed

bash scripts/audit_all.sh

Result summary:

[PASS] go test ./...
[PASS] go vet audit
[PASS] format audit
[PASS] AI rules audit
[PASS] file size audit
[PASS] hexagonal import audit
[PASS] route capability audit
[PASS] security gosec audit
[PASS] aggregate audit passed
```

Relevant grep output confirmed Progress Write Gate anchors in scripts and docs.

## LOCAL PROOF UPDATE

Owner-provided local proof on 2026-06-08 confirms the Progress Write Gate entrypoint hardening passes local audit gates.

Commands/output provided:

```text
bash scripts/audit_ai_rules.sh

Result:

[PASS] AI rules audit passed

Aggregate audit output provided:

bash scripts/audit_all.sh

Result summary:

[PASS] go test ./...
[PASS] go vet audit
[PASS] format audit
[PASS] AI rules audit
[PASS] file size audit
[PASS] hexagonal import audit
[PASS] route capability audit
[PASS] security gosec audit
[PASS] aggregate audit passed

Relevant grep output confirms Progress Write Gate anchors are present in:

scripts/audit_ai_rules.sh
docs/core/0013_proof_and_progress.md
docs/workflow/0072_transition_progress_ledger_protocol.md
docs/workflow/0071_handoff_protocol.md
docs/templates/0122_web_ai_session_prompts.md
docs/handoffs/2026-06-08-progress-write-gate-entrypoint-hardening.md
docs/handoffs/2026-06-08-progress-write-gate-hardening.md
docs/0003_session_start_protocol.md
docs/AGENTS.md
docs/README.md

Local proof and remote connector proof are now both available for Progress Write Gate entrypoint visibility.

Status:

remote-visible through GitHub connector; local audit proof passed

## GAP

- The audit checks stable text anchors, not full semantic correctness of every future AI response.
- Future AI output still depends on the selected prompt template and owner-provided scope packet.

## PROGRESS

Estimated scope progress percentage: 100%.

Progress Write Gate entrypoint hardening is locally validated by owner-provided local proof.

This does not change Laravel-to-Go implementation progress.

## NEXT

Execution channel: owner/local terminal.

Review and publish this handoff status correction, then request Web AI connector validation for the updated handoff if needed.

## CONTEXT WINDOW STATUS

Risky-moderate. This handoff exists to prevent future sessions from relying on long chat memory.

## PATCH TARGET SUMMARY

Expected changed files:

```text
docs/README.md
docs/AGENTS.md
docs/0003_session_start_protocol.md
scripts/audit_ai_rules.sh
docs/handoffs/2026-06-08-progress-write-gate-entrypoint-hardening.md
```
