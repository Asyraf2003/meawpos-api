# Handoff: ServiceCatalog Runtime Capability Blueprint Accepted

## Date

2026-06-08

## Active Scope

Accept ServiceCatalog runtime/capability blueprint 0027 before HTTP runtime implementation.

## Files Changed

```text
docs/blueprints/0027_servicecatalog_runtime_capability_slice.md
docs/evidence/0003_laravel_to_go_transition_progress_ledger.md
docs/handoffs/2026-06-08-servicecatalog-runtime-capability-blueprint-accepted.md
```

## FACT

- ServiceCatalog domain contract is accepted.
- ServiceCatalog domain/usecase implementation is closed with proof.
- ServiceCatalog PostgreSQL persistence implementation is closed with proof.
- Blueprint 0027 is accepted as the runtime/capability implementation plan.

## DECISION

Implementation may proceed only within blueprint 0027 scope.

Do not implement ProductCatalog, UI, public unauthenticated ServiceCatalog routes, physical delete, inventory behavior, broad audit sink behavior, or idempotency-key implementation in this slice.

## PROOF

Acceptance proof:

```bash
bash scripts/audit_route_capabilities.sh
make verify
```

## PROGRESS

ServiceCatalog runtime/capability blueprint: accepted.

ServiceCatalog runtime/capability implementation: 0%.

Business Phase 1: unchanged at 25%.

Overall Laravel-to-Go transition: unchanged at 25%.

## NEXT

Execution channel: owner/local terminal.

Implement the accepted ServiceCatalog runtime/capability slice from blueprint 0027.
